## What's in it?

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| Match Predictor | Win/draw/loss probabilities for any fixture, group stage through the final |
| Monte Carlo Simulator | Simulates the full 48-team tournament 10,000 times. Who lifts the trophy? Run it and find out |
| The Atlas | Spin an interactive 3D globe of all 48 nations, click any country and get their full story: squad, Elo, all-time record, group path. Host nations get their own animated mascots |
| Matchup Sandbox | Pick any two nations, any round, watch a pregame cutscene and get the model's call |
| Live Group Standings | Real tables rebuilt from live results with the full FIFA 2026 tiebreaker sequence applied, not an approximation |
| Knockout Bracket | Redraws in real time as results land, with the champion's path traced all the way through |
| Championship Odds | Every team's title shot updated off the latest simulation run |

## Under the Hood

| Frontend | Data & ML | Maps & Animation |
|---|---|---|
| React 19 | XGBoost | Three.js |
| Vite | Monte Carlo | GSAP |
| | football-data.org | Natural Earth |
| | ESPN API | D3 |

## Run Process

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # localhost:5173
```

Runs fully offline on a bundled snapshot, no keys needed. For live results:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# drop in FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY, free at football-data.org
```

## Model Architecture

| Stat | Reality |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | ~46.2% on a three-class problem (win / draw / loss) |
| Weakest class | Draws, the hardest call in football |
| Train/test split | Date-based, not random. No leakage from future results |
| What it predicts | Outcomes, not scorelines. Displayed scores are always real results |
| Simulation | 10,000 Monte Carlo runs sampling from model probabilities per match |

Strong read on a football tournament. Not God.

## Data

| Source | Used for |
|---|---|
| football-data.org | Live results, match schedule, LIVE indicator |
| ESPN API | Lineups, in-game stats, current match minute |
| Natural Earth | Globe coastlines, host-country sub-maps, country outlines |
| Wikimedia Commons | Stadium photography (CC-licensed, attributed per venue) |
| FIFA rankings snapshot | Team strength baseline and tiebreaker inputs |

## Deployment

Vercel. Auto-deploys on push to `main`. football-data.org key lives server-side, never touches the client bundle. Degrades gracefully to the static snapshot if no key is set.
